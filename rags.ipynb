      "FAQ\n",
      "What the ... ?\n",
      "Zharta is a real-time NFT loan platform for borrowers and lenders.\n",
      "Our smart contracts allow you to get instant liquidity from your NFTs without having to sell them.\n",
      "Zharta’s platform was designed to be user-friendly and accessible to anyone, regardless of their level of experience. Thanks to our permissionless protocol, you can get a loan instantly. You can also bundle several NFTs into a single loan, and you will only pay interest on the number of days it actually took you to repay the loan. Additionally, our loans are maturity-based and guarantee liquidation protection during the full time of the loan.\n",
      "Currently, we only support desktop devices. We recommend Google Chrome or Firefox for a better experience.\n",
      "No. Borrowers will only be charged for the interest, which will be split between Zharta and the lending pool.\n",
      "Yes. Our protocol supports EIP-1271, allowing for signature verification when an account is a smart contract. Zharta's smart contracts support Gnosis Safe multi-sig, but the dApp is not yet supported.\n",
      "No. Zharta doesn't get custody of your assets. NFTs used as collateral are held in a smart contract escrow. This means that the assets are held by the smart contract itself, and are always subject to the pre-agreed business rules of the loan.\n",
      "Smart contracts are programs stored within the blockchain that work as self-executing contracts. Once the two parties agree upon the terms, these are coded into the contract and deployed to the blockchain, thus rendering the transaction irreversible, traceable and transparent.\n",
      "No. Our loans offer full protection from liquidation during the term of the loan. Your loan will only default if you fail to pay on time.\n",
      "No, the interest charged is pro rata. Even if you take out a loan with a longer duration than you need, you will only pay for the days that passed until you repaid the loan (with a 7-day minimum).\n",
      "Yes, you can bundle several assets into a single loan.\n",
      "You can select the capital you want to borrow and we’ll help you choose the assets that best support your loan. If you don't agree with our selection, you are free to customize the NFTs you want to use, provided they match the value required for the loan you chose.\n",
      "Yes. Zharta allows for non-custodial loans on top of decentralized smart contracts to take advantage of the strength, transparency, and security of the blockchain networks where your assets are located.\n",
      "As a summary, Zharta's Appraisal Model makes use of Floor Price and Trait Boosts to appraise NFTs. This means that more common NFTs will be valued at their collection's base value, while rarer NFTs will be valued at a multiplier of the collection's base value.\n",
      "See Loan Conditions section in the app for more information regarding the Floor Prices and Trait Boosts available for a selected group of NFT collections.\n",
      "When a borrower defaults, their collateralized assets enter a 48 hours grace period. They can repay their loans with a penalty fee to get their NFTs back during this time. After the grace period ends, we will give the lenders the option to purchase the NFTs at a quoted price for 48 hours. If the assets are not sold then, they will be automatically sold to a 3rd party at the current market price.\n",
      "We are always evaluating the market and adding new collections according to our metrics. If you would like to see your favorite collection on our platform, please fill out this form and we will make sure to study it.\n",
      "Go to https://app.zharta.io/borrow. Connect your wallet (you only need to do this in the beginning) and select the currency and period for your loan. Use the slider to select the loan amount. If auto-select is toggled on, after you choose how much you want to borrow assets will be chosen and suggested to you automatically. You can deselect assets that you don't want to use.\n",
      "Alternatively, you can toggle auto-select off and manually select the assets you want to collateralize, and we’ll adjust the amount you can loan accordingly.\n",
      "If you choose to approve the given quote, you are all set. Congrats!\n",
      "Go to https://app.zharta.io/lend. Connect your wallet (you only need to do this the first time) and choose a lending pool. Click deposit, choose an amount, and you’re done! After making a deposit, you’ll be able to bid for defaulted NFTs that are in your pool and, after a 7-day lock-up period, withdraw the invested amount and your gains.\n",
      "MetaMask – A browser extension and mobile app. MetaMask is Web3’s most popular wallet and one of the oldest players in the industry.\n",

      "(iii) If a loan is approved, you will proceed according to the terms established.\n",
      "(iv) You are solely responsible for carrying out the repayment in full for the agreed-upon amount.\n",
      "(v) You acknowledge that the deposit of NFTs as collateral only supports the collections listed and that it is a requirement to gain access to the loan.\n",
      "(vi) You will comply with all applicable laws in submitting each loan proposal.\n",

      "3.2. For each deposit, there is a lock period of seven (7) days during which you cannot withdraw the selected amount.\n",
      "3.3. As a Lender, you agree to comply with our policies and practices as set forth herein, even though they can be revised from time to time, and also that:\n",
